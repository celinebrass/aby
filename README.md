# aby

Aby, short for "Am I Broke Yet?" was an API developed for a Software Engineering Summit at Capital One.  The API uses Nessie (Capital One's
hackathon API) to gather six months worth of customer purchase history and predict spending habits over the next month.

Aby was built using nodejs, express, and parse.
